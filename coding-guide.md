## Introduction

This document provides guidelines for best practices and coding style for ASP.NET Core projects. Following these guidelines will help ensure that code is readable, maintainable, and consistent across the project.

## Naming Conventions

### General

- Use descriptive names for variables, methods, classes, and other identifiers.
- Use PascalCase for class names and method names.
- Use camelCase for variable names.
- Avoid using abbreviations or acronyms unless they are well-known and widely used.

### Controllers

- Use the `Controller` suffix for controller classes.
- Use the `[HttpGet]`, `[HttpPost]`, `[HttpPut]`, `[HttpDelete]`, and `[HttpPatch]` attributes to decorate controller methods based on the HTTP method they handle.
- Use the `[ApiController]` attribute to decorate controller classes that use the `[FromBody]` parameter binding.
- Use the `[Route]` attribute to specify the URL pattern for a controller or action.

### Models

- Use the singular form of the entity name for model classes.
- Use the `Key` attribute to mark the primary key property of a model class.
- Use the `[Required]` attribute to mark required properties of a model class.
- Use the `[StringLength]` attribute to specify the maximum length of a string property.

### Views

- Use the `.cshtml` file extension for view files.
- Use the `@model` directive at the top of the view file to specify the model type.
- Use the `HtmlHelper` class to generate HTML elements in views.

## Code Formatting

### General

- Use consistent indentation (4 spaces) and spacing throughout the code.
- Use braces to enclose blocks of code, even if they contain a single statement.
- Avoid using multiple statements on a single line.
- Keep lines of code short (less than 120 characters).
- Use line breaks to improve readability.

### Controllers

- Use the `[FromBody]` parameter binding for complex input data.
- Use the `[FromQuery]` parameter binding for simple query parameters.
- Use the `[FromRoute]` parameter binding for URL parameters.

### Models

- Use the `IValidatableObject` interface to implement custom validation for models.

### Views

- Use Razor syntax to embed server-side code in views.
- Use partial views to reuse common sections of code.

## Error Handling

- Use exception handling to handle unexpected errors.
- Use the `try-catch` block to catch exceptions.
- Log exceptions using a logging framework such as Serilog.

## Logging

- Use a logging framework such as Serilog to log messages.
- Log error messages with the `Error` method.
- Log warning messages with the `Warning` method.
- Log information messages with the `Information` method.
- Log debug messages with the `Debug` method.

## Security

- Use HTTPS for all communication between clients and the server.
- Use password hashing and salting to store passwords.
- Use authentication and authorization to control access to resources.
- Use input validation to prevent attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting.

## Performance

- Use caching to improve performance.
- Use asynchronous programming to improve scalability.
- Use lazy loading to improve startup time.

## Testing

- Write unit tests for all code.
- Use a testing framework such as xUnit or NUnit.

## Conclusion

By following these best practices and coding style guidelines, your ASP.NET
